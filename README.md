# Calculator
Web app calculator created from scratch on javascript

This is the final project of The Odin Project foundation course. 100% of the code is original and created by me.

Building this calculator has been a great experience that I enjoyed a lot. Despite of getting stuck a couple of times due to minor problems, all the logic came out to work smoothly.
